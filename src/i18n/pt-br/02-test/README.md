# Test 2

### Code with `controllerAs` Syntax

* Controllers used: `pageController` and `guitarController`
* ControllerAs used: `vm` and `vm`.

**Result**: You can see [here](http://ericdouglas.github.io/angular-scope-inheritance/src/02-test/index.html) that if you use the `controllerAs` syntax, even the variables having the same name, they don't produce any interference in each other. **That is very good**!!!
