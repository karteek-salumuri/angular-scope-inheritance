# Test 3

### Code with `controllerAs` Syntax

* Controllers used: `pageController` and `guitarController`
* ControllerAs used: `pageCtrl` and `guitarCtrl`.

**Result**: You can see [here]() that if you use the `controllerAs` syntax, even the variables having different names that the ones used  for `this` in their respective controller, they don't produce any bad behavior. **That is very good also**!!!
